Backend: market endpoints now disabled by default unless BASALTOS_LOCAL_MARKET_ENABLED=1, and generate/preview sanitize market_apps when disabled. Frontend: local scope flags hide market/profile entry points and prevent market/profile event bindings; landing copy updated to dev-tool scope. Validation: core API smoke passes and /api/market/catalog returns 404 with explicit disabled message."
